# Git-Step-By-Step

This repository documents my structured process of learning Git from the ground up.
Each step focuses on a specific concept—commits, branches, rebasing, merging, conflict resolution, and workflows—explored through small, intentional experiments rather than isolated commands.

The goal is not memorization, but understanding: how Git thinks, how history is shaped, and how common workflows behave under real changes.

What this repo emphasizes

Incremental learning, one concept at a time

Hands-on examples instead of command lists

Common mistakes and recovery strategies

Mental models behind Git operations

Who this is for

Developers new to Git

Developers who “use Git” but want to truly understand it

Anyone who prefers learning by doing and breaking things safely

What this is not

A comprehensive Git reference

A copy of official documentation

A polished tutorial — this is a learning log
